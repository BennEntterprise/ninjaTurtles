# The Ninja Turtles

One of the biggest benefits of being a Javascript developer is that you have the
ability to be a very versatile creator! The purpose of "The Ninja Turtles" is
to show off that versatility by having 4 project that hit on the major areas
a javascript developer could expect to work in. Your ninja turtles should look
roughly like this

- A single page application built with React
- A Desktop Application with that runs on Electron
- A Server Application built with NodeJS
- A Native Mobile App Built with React-Native and Expo.

If being able to do all that with one language doesn't make you feel like you're
oozing with power than I don't know what will! (Img:"Can you feel it crunk")

If you want to get hired at any job you apply for (and command an astronomically
high salary) you'll want to have an example of each one of these in your
portfolio. They key is to make these turtles super simple, that you add
complexity over time. Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo and Mikey didn't become masters
overnight! They grew, and so too will your turtles.

So in addition to your weekly widgets, which showcase slices of functionality,
these turtles will eventually be some of your best work. And guess what, if you
decide you want to swap one out... that's fine too! It's your portfolio, you can
do what you want!!

So what should your turtles look like? Well that can be pretty hard to come up
with if you're new to development. If you join my course Zero To Full Stack,
you'll get 1 free month of community membership where you can talk with others
to see what they've built. I'm sure they can help find the perfect project for you.
Additionally, if you sign up before Nov 1, I'll have a one on one meeting where
I help brainstorm some great projects to get started!

If you're still on the fence you can take a look at my Turtles. Below.

Web: Divii
Divii is an app where you can make predictions. These are stored in a notebook and a little later on, you are reminded to see if your predictions came true!

- Will your sibling give birth to a niece or a nephew ?
- Who will win office (or Superbowl)
- Which tech stocks will go down next?

Server: "Divii API"
This server handles the traffic for the above web application. A REST api allow the web app to communicate with a mongo database.

Desktop: "Babel-Phish"
Babel-Phish integrates with you spotify library so you can learn languages while you listen! Open up a song if it's not in your native language the app will provide side-by-side translated lyrics to the song.

Mobile: "Where am I?"
This app allows you to collect your own location at the click of a button. Once you're done you can export these locations as text, and send a quick email to yourself. This is great if you need to quickly create a path or area and you have the ability to walk/drive that area.
